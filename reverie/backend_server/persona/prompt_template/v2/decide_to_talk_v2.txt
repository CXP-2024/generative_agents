Example:
Context: [Mary is at the park. She sees John sitting on a bench. They haven't spoken in a while.]
Question: [Will Mary initiate a conversation with John?]
Reasoning: [Mary is outgoing and enjoys talking to her friends. She hasn't seen John in a while, so she might be curious about how he's doing. Therefore, it's likely that she will initiate a conversation with him.]
Answer in "yes" or "no": [yes]

Context: !<INPUT 0>! 
Right now, it is !<INPUT 1>!. !<INPUT 2>! and !<INPUT 3>! last chatted at !<INPUT 4>! about !<INPUT 5>!. 

Information about !<INPUT 2>!:
!<INPUT 6>!

Information about !<INPUT 3>!:
!<INPUT 7>!

Relationship between !<INPUT 2>! and !<INPUT 3>!:
!<INPUT 8>!

Question: Will !<INPUT 9>! initiate a conversation with !<INPUT 10>!?

Note: Consider only !<INPUT 9>!'s perspective: their thoughts, feelings, and motivations. Do not assume any knowledge of !<INPUT 10>!'s personality or state.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step. (You should consider somebody's personality, the context, the location and time, and the relationship between the two people and other things. For example, if somebody is curious, they might initiate a conversation. If they are introverted, they might not or debate whether to initiate a conversation.)
