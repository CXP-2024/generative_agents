Based on Monday\u2019s pattern, he likely starts his focused work session by late morning or early afternoon.  \n- **Task Management:** He prioritizes tasks linked to **ID:2Nakdu** (afternoon) and **ID:mwCKir** (evening), ensuring they are addressed to avoid delays in his project.  \n- **Evening (18:25 PM - 22:00 PM):** He engages in intensive writing and research sessions at his desk, similar to Monday, with scheduled breaks. Around **21:10 PM**, he winds down by reading sociology articles from his saved list.  \n- **Night (22:15 PM):** He changes into pajamas using the closet, maintaining his strict sleep schedule for optimal rest.  \n\nKlaus remains highly organized, keeping his workspace clutter-free to facilitate seamless transitions between tasks.
